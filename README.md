VeloGuide
=========

Urban Bike Guide for iOS.  The intention of this app is to provide bike path maps, current location and status 
of bike paths and parking via twitter, and relveant local bike laws.  The main suported regions are Portland, 
San Francisco and NYC.  The data is a few years old at this point though and needs to be updated.

This was initially developed for iOS 4 and has been updated and tested to work with iOS 7.  I have recovered my
initial time and investment in it and am making it open and free on the iOS store in the hopes others mind find something useful in it and
build on to it, or use parts of the source data to build something better.

Currently it has regional bike path data in KML format for Portland, San Fran and NYC.  It also has a decent bike 
parking layer for Portland and Chicago.  Id like to add more but haven't seen good data sets exportable to KML or 
JSON yet.  The bike laws and guides section features jump links to relevant sections as a well as a minimal Javscript 
highlight search.  It also has a minimal twitter layer for tweeting current position on the map using the hashtag #veloguide.
