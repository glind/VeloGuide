        <h2>The Law</h2>
        <p><i>While you will find a lot of useful information here, the best way to learn about the law and your rights and responsibilities while bicycling is to take one of our popular <a href="?edu">free Urban Cycling Workshops</a>.</i></p>
        <p>
        
        
        <p>1. <b>Pedestrians have the right of way -- always.</b> (CVC 21954(b))</p>
        
        <p>2. <b>Stop behind the crosswalk -- always.</b> Leave crosswalks free and clear for safe walking. (CVC 21950, 21455)</p>
        
        <p>3. <b>Take it to the Streets.</b> Ride in the street. It's illegal to ride on the sidewalk if you are over the age of 13. (SF Transportation Code (SFTC) Sec. 7.2.12)</p>
        
        <p>4. <b>Go with the flow.</b> Bike lane or shared lane, ride the same direction as traffic, always. Walk your bike on the sidewalk if you find yourself on the wrong block of a one way street. (CVC 21650)</p>
        
        <p>5. <b>Mind the signs.</b> Bikes must stop at stop signs and obey red lights, just like all other vehicles. (CVC 21200)</p>
        
        <p>6. <b>Light up the Night!</b> Reflectors and a front white light are required by law. But we recommend that you be as bright as you can, including a back light, too. (CVC 21201)</p>
        
        <p>7. <b>Use the full lane.</b> Whether you're next to parked cars, or there are hazards in the bike lane, if you feel safer, take the lane. (CVC 21202)</p>
        
        <p>8. <b>It's OK to leave the bike lane.</b> If you feel safer outside the bike lane, you can ride in other vehicle travel lanes. (CVC 21208)</p>
        
        <p>9. <b>Be a friend to disabled neighbors.</b> Sometimes people with disabilities need access to the curb. Paratransit carriers (including taxis) sometimes have to enter the bikeway to drop them off. Be a good neighbor and give them room. (SFMTA Policy)</p>
        <p>
        <p>
        
    
         
         <p>As one of the seven in ten San Franciscans who rides a bike, you have the right to move about the City safely and use the streets just like the driver of any other vehicle. Indeed, California Vehicle Code (CVC) 21200 specifies that people riding bicycles have all the same rights and responsibilities and are subject to the same provisions as people driving motor vehicles.</p>
