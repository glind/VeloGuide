    <h2>Car Doored Again? The Law Is OnYour Side!</h2>
    It is always a pleasure to find out that the law is in our favor when bicyclists have a conflict on the road with motorists. Usually, conflicts relate to the question of who has the right to the same space at the same time. Usually a motorist fails to see a bicycle rider and opens a door so close to the bicycle that an accident or near miss occurs. Bicycle messengers call it being “car-doored.” While defensive riding can go a long way toward avoiding painful encounters with car doors, some- times there is nothing a rider can do — everything happens too fast. Fortunately, this is one of those areas where the law is on the side of the bicycle rider.
    Oregon’sVehicle Code (remember, bicycles are “vehicles” too) pro- hibits opening the door of any vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so:
    ORS 811.490 Improper opening or leaving open of vehicle door; penalty. (1) A person commits the offense of improper opening or leaving open a vehicle door if the person does any of the following:
    (a) Opens any door of a vehicle unless and until it is reasonably safe to do so and it can be done without interference with the movement of traffic, or with pedestrians and bicycles on sidewalks or shoulders.
    (b) Leaves a door open on the side of a vehicle available to traffic, or to pedestrians or bicycles on sidewalks or shoulders for a period of time longer than necessary to load or unload passengers.
    (2) The offense described in this section, improper opening or leaving open a vehicle door, is a Class D traffic infraction.
    The scheduled fine amount for a Class D Traffic Infraction is $90.00. Note that the law makes it illegal not only to open the door when it interferes with people trying to get by, but it is also illegal to leave the door open longer than necessary to load or unload passengers.
    7
    8	BICYCLE LAWS
    One would think that the law is so clear cut that disputes would never arise over who was right and wrong in this type of an accident. Frequently, the motorist is apologetic and completely willing to accept blame at the scene (in spite of the advice on many insurance identifica- tion cards “do not accept fault for the accident”), but by the time the motorist thinks about it and talks to an insurance adjuster or attorney, their view of the accident changes. The revised version goes some- thing like this: “I opened my car door with plenty of distance behind me for the approaching bicyclist to see it. If the bicyclist had been paying attention, he or she would have seen that my door was open and ridden around it. Since I only intended to have the door open long enough to get out of the car, the accident is mostly the fault of the bicyclist.” Believe it or not, this argument is enough to inject a note of comparative negligence on the part of the bicyclist into the equation in most cases.
    The percentage of comparative fault works a pro rata reduction in the amount of damages, so the effect is significant. Add the fact that most of the members of any jury will identify primarily with the motorist, not the bicycle rider, and you have a recipe for disappoint- ment for an injured bicycle rider. Remember, under Oregon’s system of comparative fault, if a jury decides that the motorist was partly at fault for opening the car door (less than 50%) but the bicyclist was mostly at fault (more than 50%) for failing to pay close enough atten- tion and to make a reasonable effort to avoid striking the open door, then the bicyclist loses in court (even though the motorist violated the vehicle code by his or her own admission).
    My experience investigating these cases is that in almost every car door accident the motorist is primarily at fault. However, it is essential in every case that the bicyclist carefully remember and reconstruct the scene of the accident to demonstrate that there was not enough time to take necessary evasive action in order to avoid hitting the door. Usually, bicycle riders relate that things just happened too fast. There was sim- ply not enough time to avoid the car door. Nevertheless, there are some things that riders can do to make this surprising and frequently painful event less likely to occur.
    CAR DOORED AGAIN? THE LAW IS ON YOUR SIDE	9
    Scan the cars in the parking lane
    Bicyclists have a duty to ride as far to the right as practicable, but the law allows us to take up to a full lane, if necessary, to avoid hazards like car doors. When riding alongside parked cars, scan ahead and watch for occupants. If there is sun glare on the windows, decorative louvers on the rear window, or some other obstruction that prevents you from seeing through the glass, assume that someone is going to be getting out of a parked vehicle and adjust your place in the road accordingly.
    Ease your way between parked and moving cars
    Most riders choose not to ride with mirrors. There is no law that makes mirrors mandatory equipment, and many riders have developed the skills necessary to identify approaching cars which may constitute a hazard by sound, and to look behind them without changing their “line” or position in the roadway. These are essential skills for riding around parked cars because if somebody does open a door in front of you, there is frequently very little time to react. If you do not know your position in relation to overtaking traffic, you may find yourself swerving from the car door into the path of an overtaking vehicle.
    A simple solution is to ride with a rearview mirror. Mirrors are not looked upon as cool accessories. Mostly favored by the commuter set, I can’t remember the last time I saw anyone using one during the Tour de France. Nevertheless, a properly adjusted mirror is a great safety accessory. I have been riding with either a handlebar-mounted or helmet-mounted mirror for about ten years. I use one because fre- quently I just do not have time to turn my head and look behind me. It seems that a mirror provides the rider with the essential instanta- neous scanning of the rear view before necessary evasive action. I am not saying that it is unsafe to ride without a mirror, but I have certainly come to rely upon mine.
    While it is nice to have the law on your side if you have an encounter with a car door, it is better to avoid the experience in the first place. Stay attentive to the intentions of occupants of parked cars, maintain your distance from parked cars, and consider using a rearview mirror. These are all ways you can avoid having to demonstrate to another driver or an insurance adjuster that the law is on your side in an accident.

    <h2>Oregon’s 2006 Crosswalk Laws</h2>
    The Oregon law of crosswalks has been in such a state of change that motorists and non-motorized roadway users view crosswalk encounters with mutual distrust and apprehension. For good reason. While the laws in Oregon’s vehicle code clearly provide non-motorists with the right of way in crosswalks, the laws of physics require careful assertion of pedestrian legal rights on the street.
    Oregon’s policy makers have taken significant steps toward promot- ing non-motorized use of the state’s roadways as a good direction for citizens. General concern about exercise causing and good health, new laws like the 2005 Safe Routes to School legislation and the new cross- walk law have improved conditions for non-motorized roadway users. Oregon commercial interests interested wanting to establish Oregon as a recreation destination have placed countless images of humans enjoy- ing Oregon’s roadways before the public eye, and law enforcement per- sonnel have been willing to include protection of the most vulnerable roadway users within their mission. Pedestrian advocacy groups like the Willamette Pedestrian Coalition are becoming increasingly well organized; i.e. as more and more Oregonians identify themselves with non-motorized roadway users, positive inertia toward improvement of conditions make the Spring of 2006 the most exciting season ever for Oregon’s walkers, bicyclists, skaters, bladers, and rollers.
    Oregon law treats all non-motorized crosswalk users as if they were pedestrians, even bicyclists. The Oregon 2005 Legislature attempted to clarify away a confusing section of the law relating to when a motorist must stop and wait for a pedestrian. Unfortunately, the new law is somewhat difficult to read and is linked in the minds of many citizens with the uncertainties associated with the school zone speed limit law. The end result is ignorance combined with apprehension.
    11
    12	BICYCLE LAWS
    Oregon Crosswalk Law What is a Pedestrian?
    The current Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) governing crosswalks went into effect in January of 2006. It applies to “pedestrians” who are defined as “any person afoot or confined in a wheelchair.” ORS 801.385.
    What Is A Crosswalk?
    Everyone knows what a marked crosswalk is because you can see it. However, an “unmarked” crosswalk is a little more difficult to define because it is invisible. An “unmarked crosswalk” is a place where a “marked crosswalk” would be placed between two corners if someone decided to paint crosswalk lines. Even though it is “invisible”, an unmarked crosswalk incorporates the same legal rights as a marked cross- walk. If one looks at a traditional four corner uncontrolled intersection, the unmarked crosswalks connect each corner. There is no diagonal crosswalk in Oregon.
    The New 2006 Crosswalk Law
    The pedestrian crosswalk law requires that vehicles allow pedestri- ans to exercise the right of way in a marked, or unmarked crosswalk or with a walk signal if the pedestrian is in the lane or next to the lane of travel. Further, if the intersection has a traffic control device, the vehicle must yield if the pedestrian is less than six feet from the lane into which the vehicle is turning. If the roadway has a safety island, then the vehicle must only yield when the pedestrian is on the vehicle’s side of the island. And ORS 811.020 also requires all overtaking vehicles to stop if one vehicle stops to allow a pedestrian to cross and remain stopped.
    The new crosswalk law also provides greater protection for pedes- trians at intersections without traffic control signals; on a street with- out a signal, the driver may proceed only if the lane involved in a turn and the adjacent lane, are clear of pedestrians.
    So Much Power, So Little Bulk
    Substantial legal rights of pedestrians in crosswalks tend to melt away on the streets. The superior mass of a speeding motor vehicle cre- ates a dicey situation any time it is unclear whether a motorist intends to actually yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Intentional intimidation
    OREGON’S 2006 CROSSWALK LAWS	13
    by motorists feels more dangerous when one is not surrounded by sev- eral thousand pounds of sheet metal.
    If the pedestrian is not in a marked or unmarked crosswalk, then vehicular traffic has the right-of-way. This does not mean that pedestri- ans are prohibited from crossing the road except at crosswalks, only that away from a crosswalk the pedestrian must yield the superior right-of-way to the vehicle.
    Bicycles and Crosswalks
    Bicycles are both protected and discriminated against by Oregon’s crosswalk law. While bicycles are considered to be vehicles under Oregon law and must, therefore, yield the right-of-way to pedestrians just like any other vehicle, bicycles may also be operated in crosswalks. While on the one hand Oregon law allows bicyclists to have the right- of-way in crosswalks like a pedestrian, the law also sets a speed limit for bicycle riders that conditions the right-of-way on proceeding no faster than a “walking speed”. ORS 814.410. Thus, a bicycle, which easily travels at speeds much faster than running shoes, rollerblades, skate- boards, jog strollers, perambulators, and wheelbarrows (all pedestrian accessories) is held to the lowest speed of any member of the group; kids on skateboards may maintain a higher legal speed in a crosswalk than their parent on a bicycle under Oregon’s crosswalk law. Bicycle advocates like the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA) have been unsuccessful for over ten years in convincing the legislature that the law should be changed to include language that would allow bicyclists to proceed at a “reasonably safe speed” in a crosswalk and maintain the right-of-way. While the law makes some sense as motorists should not have to yield the right-of-way to bicycle riders speeding across inter- sections like galloping urban deer, few bicyclists know about the “walk- ing speed” limit and invariably the law gets used against bicycle riders who are struck by a careless motorist when the bicyclist thought he or she was lawfully crossing the street. Insurance companies use the bicy- cle crosswalk law against bicycle riders to blindside injury claims, creat- ing an unfair result that sometimes adds legal insult to injury.
    While bicyclists may lawfully use all crosswalks, there are restric- tions in Oregon’s cities on bicycle riding on sidewalks in certain core areas. Most sidewalk restrictions are poorly signed so it is unclear where one can and cannot ride. Both our book Pedal Power and our
    14	BICYCLE LAWS
    website (www.stc-law.com) contain a collection of city laws regarding sidewalk restrictions.
    Oregon law also requires that bicyclists both yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and provide an audible signal when passing a pedestrian on a sidewalk. The Oregon legal system allows pedestrians and bicy- clists to share the sidewalk without speed restrictions while the cross- walk sets an unnecessarily harsh speed limit of a “walking speed” for bicyclists. This bad law sends the wrong signal to visiting bicyclists and is at odds with the state’s efforts to provide bicycle lanes and shared use recreation areas.

    <h2>How To Send All The Right Signals</h2>
    
    I can’t remember when I started to use hand turn signals while riding my bicycle. Until that moment it always seemed unnecessary, kind of like a pedestrian signaling an intent to make a change in direc- tion. Actually, I think I began using hand signals at about the same time I decided that I was really a skilled bicycle rider — it was a sort of add- on accessory to my riding skills. Now that I have been doing it for a few years it seems so natural to me that I don’t know how I got along with- out it.
    Before I began using signals, I remember being chastised by some of my riding companions for holding myself out as a bike legal expert on the one hand and failing to follow the law about signals. The first few times I used signals I remember it feeling odd and unnecessary. Then I had a few experiences where I was able to move easily through traffic because drivers knew my intentions and we were able to share the road in a cooperative manner. Motorists appreciate it that I am giving them a way to predict my stops and turns. Now I use signals whenever I am in traffic, and it is almost second nature.
    Riders need to know that the law requires us to use signals for turns and stops.
    Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 814.440 provides as follows:
    814.440 Failure to signal turn; exceptions, penalty.
    (1) A person commits the offense of failure to signal for a bicycle turn if the person does any of the following:
    (a) Stops a bicycle the person is operating without giving the appropriate hand and arm signal continuously for at least 100 feet before executing the stop. (b) Executes a turn on a bicycle the person is operating without giving the appropriate hand and arm signal for the turn for at least 100 feet before executing the turn.
    15
    16
    BICYCLE LAWS
    (c) Executes a turn on a bicycle the person is operating after hav- ing been stopped without giving, while stopped, the appropriate hand and arm signal for the turn.
    (2) A person is not in violation of the offense under this section if the person is operating a bicycle and does not give the appropriate signal continuously for a stop or turn because circumstances require that both hands be used to safely control or operate the bicycle. (3) The appropriate hand and arm signals for indicating turns and stops under this section are those provided for other vehicles under ORS 811.395 and 811.400. (4) The offense described under this section, failure to signal for a bicycle turn, is a Class D traffic infraction.
    The fine for a Class D infraction is $90.00.
    From a legal standpoint, the statue provides a stringent standard, but, fortunately, one with an exception within it that allows us to sus- pend our signaling in order to maintain control over the bicycle. I suspect the statute was written at a time when most riders were using the old coaster brakes that relied on backward pedal rotation instead of hand levers. Signaling a turn or stop for 100 feet requires some skill- ful coordination, particularly during a downhill section with a stop or turn at the bottom (it is hard to use a hand brake and signal at the same time). Fortunately, the law allows us an exception so that we can main- tain control over our bicycles, and I frequently find myself signaling a left turn by putting my arm out into a signal and then pulling it back in to squeeze the front brake lever several times before I finally stop or turn.
    Because the signal rule has the force of law, it contains a potential legal trap for unwary cyclists — it can be used against a bicyclist who fails to signal and then is hit by a negligent motorist. For example, let’s say that you intend to make a left turn on a rural highway. As you veer out and across the traffic lane from your position near the fog line (next to the shoulder), you hear a car coming up from behind you and (sur- prised), you accelerate, hoping to complete your turn before the car overtakes you. Unfortunately, the car is going faster than you thought, the driver is not paying attention, and the motorist is unable to stop in time. While the driver misses hitting you, she drives her car off of the road into the ditch and hits a utility pole.
    This scenario should clearly focus legal fault on the driver. She was driving too fast, not paying close enough attention, and failed to main- tain control over her vehicle. However, the bicyclist failed to signal. If
    HOW TO SEND ALL THE RIGHT SIGNALS	17
    she or her insurance company sued the bicyclist in court for the prop- erty damage to her car, they would attempt to establish “statutory neg- ligence” on the part of the bicycle rider. After all, the bicycle rider failed to signal, and the driver would have instantly been able to see that the bicyclist was slowing to turn if a proper arm signal had been used. The lack of a signal in all likelihood contributed to the accident. As a result, a clear liability accident is now a shared liability accident and the bicyclist would likely be one-half or more at fault in causing the collision. Thus, the rather bizarre result of this example is that the bicyclist would likely end up paying for several thousand dollars of automobile damage. One uncomfortable byproduct of our labors to make bicycles a more accepted and legitimate form of transportation is that insurance companies are now pursuing damage claims against bicyclists who are looked upon as being partially at fault in accidents. As a consequence, bicyclists are sometimes uncomfortable with their new found position of legitimacy (and legal responsibility), because they are looked upon as potential deep pockets in repairing the damage from collisions.
    I have had several telephone calls from bicycle riders outraged that claims are being made against them for minor property damage result- ing from damage to automobiles caused by motorists having scratched up their cars in collision with the rider. This is an example of adding insult to injury.
    Many of us are probably aware of the fact that the signal law actually evolved from legal requirements for motor vehicles and that the hand signals required of drivers evolved from the days when vehicles were not supplied with turn signals. Thus, the Oregon Revised Statute sec- tion referred to in the bicycle signal statute provides for signals which can all be accomplished with the left arm (the one that can be hung out of the driver’s window of a motor vehicle). Nevertheless, as bicyclists we are also allowed to use our right arm to make our signals. It’s your choice. Whichever type of signal you choose, be sure to include hand signals in your bicycling repertoire.

    <h2>Oregon Bicycle Lighting Requirements</h2>
    It has been exciting over the last several years to see so many recreational riders transforming themselves into bicycle commuters. This transformation has been the result of hard work by planners and bicycle advocacy organizations like the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA) to make the roads a more friendly place for bicycling com- muters. Oregon’s mild winters allow recreational riders to make the transition with little difficulty; for most commutes, a little rain gear goes a long way toward transforming short aggravating car trips into healthful bicycle rides. There is a deep sense of satisfaction that accom- panies a ride at dawn across a Willamette River bridge packed bumper to bumper with cars while on a bicycle in an uncrowded bicycle lane. However, adequate bicycle lighting is a necessary accessory for those dawn and dusk commuting rides.
    Many recreational riders choose not to ride at night. Putting together a lighting package is frequently left out of the transition to bicycle commuting because many city streets are well lit and most bicycles have reflector packages that include front and rear reflectors. While some reflector packages effectively catch and reflect light from approaching headlights, no reflector is activated unless it has light hit- ting directly upon its surface. Further, even a new bicycle with a reflec- tor package is not in legal trim to ride at night. Oregon law requires that bicycles have a white light in front, and a red reflector or light to the rear during “limited visibility conditions.”
    Violations of Oregon’s bicycle lighting law are probably the most frequently observed traffic offense committed by bicycle riders. During the winter months, it is impossible for most bicycle commuters to avoid riding during darkness at the beginning and end of their commute. While bicyclists may feel that they are visible with their yellow rain gear and reflectorized bicycles, a bicyclist involved in a collision with a car usually discovers (the hard way) the importance of Oregon’s light-
    19
    20	BICYCLE LAWS
    ing law. When the driver tells the investigating police officer about the invisibility of the cyclist, the cyclist receives a traffic citation for what would otherwise be considered an accident that was primarily the fault of the motorist.
    Psychology recognizes a common human behavior known as “case building” engaged in by people when they have committed a question- able act. While “case building” starts for most people at the moment of impact and blossoms from there, many straightforward accidents that are clearly the motorist’s fault become contested liability fights because the bicyclist failed to have a headlight. Since many accidents occur when a motor vehicle pulls out in front of a bicyclist, it is often the finding of a post-accident reconstruction that the ambient light was insufficient to activate the front reflector on the bicycle. Since the motorist was not facing directly toward the bicyclist, the car headlights did nothing to make the front reflector visible, and the motorist has some justification in claiming that the unlighted bicycle rider was at fault for failing to have a proper light. It is sometimes possible to show that ambient light, the headlights of other cars, and the bicyclist’s bright clothing combined to make the bicycle rider clearly visible if
    the motorist had been paying attention; however, a bicyclist involved in an accident at night without a headlight always has a big problem with liability.
    The law is very clear in its requirements:
    815.280 Violation of bicycle equipment requirements; penalty.
    (1) A person commits the offense of violation of bicycle equipment requirements if the person does any of the following: (c) At the times described in the following, a bicycle or its rider must
    be equipped with lighting equipment that meets the described requirements: (A) The lighting equipment must be used during limited visibility
    conditions. (B) The lighting equipment must show a white light visible from a
    distance of at least 500 feet to the front of the bicycle. (C) The lighting equipment must have a red reflector or lighting
    device or material of such size or characteristic and so mount- ed as to be visible from all distances up to 600 feet to the rear when directly in front of lawful lower beams of headlights on a motor vehicle.
    OREGON BICYCLE LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS	21
    The offense described in this section, violation of bicycle equipment requirements, is a Class D traffic violation with a maximum fine of $90.00.
    Note that helmet mounted lights (which many people prefer because they are directional) are fully compliant with the law. Further, a light is only necessary on the front. A red reflector is sufficient for the back of the bike. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) man- dates that all bicycles sold in the United States contain a reflector set. However, it is ironic that the higher end bicycles have fewer or no reflectors, and one of the first things that many riders do is remove the reflectors when they purchase a new bike. Spoke and pedal reflectors are particularly prone to making clicking noises when the bicycle is underway, and many reflectors are incompatible with bicycle racks.
    Some riders report that police officers have told them that front strobes do not comply with the law. There are no Oregon appellate deci- sions interpreting Oregon’s lighting law. It is my belief that these battery saving lights are in legal compliance with the law although probably not as good as a steady white light to the front for illuminating hidden pot holes and other hazards in the dark. Certainly a rear red strobe is okay, but the best practice is to have both a rear light and a rear reflector.
    It is also good practice to use bicycle lights during twilight or foggy conditions, any time you would be tempted to turn on your headlights if you were driving a car. Carrying a small flashlight in your pack or bike bag is a good backup in case your bike light battery goes dead or the light bulb burns out. Most bike light bulbs are pretty tough, but the combination of high pressure tires, no suspension, and rough roads frequently combine to break the little filaments in the bulb so that the replacement frequency for bike lamps is higher than on a motorized vehicle. Carrying a flashlight gives you a good backup, keeps you in compliance with the law, and will be a welcome compan- ion if you ever flat out on the way home and need to complete a road- side repair in the dark.
    Generator sets are somewhat problematic because when the bicycle stops the lights go out. While a generator set is preferable from an eco- logical standpoint (no dependence on chemical batteries that must be discarded) it is probably better to buy a modern halogen light set with rechargeable batteries. My favorite lighting systems use large recharge- able batteries that fit in the water bottle cage, because they provide a long charge and can be readily removed for daytime only riding. Most
    22	BICYCLE LAWS
    experienced night riders use a smaller light to the rear and then a larger halogen unit for the front. If you do use a rear light, make sure you mount it so that your bike bag or pack does not obstruct its view from the rear.
    Complying with Oregon’s lighting law adds a little hassle to your daily commute, but provides additional safety and confidence for night riding. Many riders are lulled into a false sense of security because new bikes have reflector systems. While few riders receive tickets for viola- tion of Oregon’s lighting law, if you are ever in an accident, violations of the lighting law will almost certainly be used against you. Bicycle lights are inexpensive to purchase and easy to mount, so add this important equipment to your night time ride.

    <h2>We Have A Right To The Freeway, But Which Freeway?</h2>
    
    Oregon bicyclists are sometimes stopped by a police officer for rid- ing a bicycle on a freeway or interstate. Riders often ask “What are my rights regarding riding on the freeway?” The exact language of the rule governing non-motorized vehicles on our freeways is as follows:
    12. SELECTED OREGON ADMINISTRATIVE RULES (OAR) THAT PERTAIN TO BICYCLISTS & PEDESTRIANS:
    Prohibition of Non-Motorized Vehicles on Freeways
    734-20-0045 (1) Non-motorized vehicles are prohibited upon the fol- lowing segments of freeways within the State of Oregon: (a) Portland area: (A)The Columbia River Highway No. 2 (Banfield/I-84) from its intersec-
    tion with I-5, MP 0.00, to 122nd Avenue, MP 10.25, east bound,
    and to Sandy Boulevard, MP 15.14, west bound; (B) The Sunset Highway No. 47 easterly of the Jefferson Street
    Interchange, MP 73.35; (C) Interstate 5 (Hwy. No. 1) from the Beaverton-Tigard Highway
    Interchange, MP 292.20, to the Delta Park Interchange, MP
    306.70; (D) Interstate 205 (Hwy No. 64) northerly of the Overcrossing of the
    Oswego Highway No. 3, MP 8.82; (E) Interstate 405 (Hwy. No. 81) in its entirety; and (F) Lower Columbia Highway No. 2W from its intersection with I-405,
    MPE0.00, to 23rd Street, MP 1.99. (b) Medford area: Interstate 5 (Pacific Highway No. 1) from the Barnet Road Interchange, MP 27.58, to the Crater Lake Highway Interchange, MP 30.29 (in Medford). (2) The closure of the above sections to nonmotorized vehicles shall become effective following the erection of adequate signing.
    23
    24	BICYCLE LAWS
    Please note that paragraph (2) provides that “adequate signing” is necessary in order to give non-motorized users notice of the closure. This means that the signs warning us off of the road must actually be in place before we are required to use an alternative route.
    No sign, no ticket. Riders familiar with the prohibited sections of roadway will probably agree, however, that no one would want to be on these sections of highway without thick sheetmetal surrounding their vulnerable bodies. If anyone is hassled about riding on lawful roadways, cite the “offending officer” to the OAR; knowledge is power.

    <h2>Bike Lanes Revisited</h2>
    
    Engage a motorist who is not a bicycle rider in a conversation about bicycles and you may be surprised to hear a frequently held view that a “bicycle revolution” has occurred in this country in the last several years. When this happens I am frequently left asking myself the ques- tion, “Did I miss something?” The answer is that from a motorists’ perspective the “bicycle revolution” is evidenced by a new presence: the bicycle lane. When most drivers obtained their driver’s licenses, bicycle lanes did not exist. Consequently, most motorists have never been taught about how to drive near bicycle lanes; the same situation applies to bicyclists. Consequently, there is much confusion on every- one’s part about how to ride in and drive near bicycle lanes.
    Bicyclists must use bike lanes if one is available
    Oregon Revised Statute 814.420 (ORS) requires that a bicyclist use a bicycle lane or path if one is available. This is the section that was used to cite a number of riders who refused to ride on bicycle paths (now called multi-use paths). Many riders refused to use the old bike paths because they were poorly constructed and infrequently main- tained. Riding at 15 mph over a bumpy (roots and potholes), glass cov- ered bike path with blind crossings for driveways was never a pleasant experience. However, paragraph 2 of ORS 814.420 states that a person is not required to comply with the rule unless the responsible jurisdic- tion has established, after a public hearing, that the bicycle lane or path is “suitable for safe bicycle use at reasonable rates of speed.” Since no one certified any of the bike paths as “suitable,” (they were inherently suitable), there was a large loophole in the law and no one was ever convicted of violating it. Now State v. Potter (Court of Appeals 2002) has switched the burden to the bicyclist to prove there was no hearing with affirmative evidence at trial. Bike lanes are presumed to be proce- durally okay, a change in the law probably closing a legal loophole.
    The 2005 Oregon legislature provided exceptions to the old mandatory usage requirement for bicycle lanes that takes actual prac-
    25
    26	BICYCLE LAWS
    tice and common sense into account. The new law provides that a rid- er may move out of the bicycle lane or path to pass, turn or avoid a hazard:
    Section 3. ORS 814.420 is amended to read:
    814.420 (1) Except as provided in [subsection (2)] subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a person commits the offense of failure to use a bicycle lane or path if the person operates a bicycle on any portion of a roadway that is not a bicycle lane or bicycle path when a bicycle lane or bicycle path is adjacent to or near the roadway. (2) A person is not required to comply with this section unless the state or local authority with jurisdiction over the roadway finds, after public hearing, that the bicycle lane or bicycle path is suitable for safe bicycle use at reasonable rates of speed.
    (3) A person is not in violation of the offense under this section if the person is able to safely move out of the bicycle lane or bicycle path for the purpose of:
    (a) Overtaking and passing another bicycle, a vehicle or pedestri- an that is in the bicycle lane or path and passage cannot safely be made in the lane or path. (b) Preparing to execute a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.
    (c) Avoiding debris or other hazardous road conitions. (d) Preparing to execute a right turn where a right turn is author- ized.
    [(3)] (4) The offense described in this section, failure to use a bicycle
    lane or path, is a Class D trafffic violation.
    The BTA Legislative Committee and membership worked effec- tively with legislators and their staffers to improve the law for all road- way users. Member phone calls, personal visits and emails helped us to get the word out that as bicycle riders we want to have a voice in setting up the rules on the roadway; as more people identify them- selves and our state in a picture that includes a bike someplace in it, the better able we are to get large numbers of people to support improvement of our safety on the roads.
    Bicycle lanes are a great improvement over the old bicycle paths. However, it is unfortunate that sometimes the bicycle lanes contain more debris than adjacent travel lanes because of the absence of high speed traffic blowing debris off of the surface. There is a real public relations problem when bicyclists fail to use designated bicycle lanes because motorists legitimately feel that considerable space and finan- cial resources are being dedicated to bicycles on the roadway and the
    BIKE LANES REVISITED	27
    least that bicyclists can do is to use the available facilities. Still, some purists refuse to recognize bicycle lanes as preferred locations of bicy- cle travel because “separate” means “unequal” on the roadway and bicyclists should never allow themselves to be “moved” anywhere off of the main roadway. All in all, bicycle lanes are an improvement for bicycling and we should use them if they are in safe condition when we are moving at a speed which would slow down motorized traffic.
    When are motor vehicles allowed on a bicycle lane?
    Bicyclists frequently complain that motorists are driving on bicycle lanes. Motorists frequently resent bicyclists’ efforts to direct them off of bicycle lanes and back into the motorized section of the roadway. The Oregon Rules of The Road provide that motorists may not use bicycle lanes unless the use fits within one of about a dozen exceptions.
    ORS 811.440 provides about four ways to get into the bike lane:
    (2) A person may operate a motor vehicle upon a bicycle lane when: (a) Making a turn; (b) Entering or leaving an alley, private road or driveway; or (c) Required in the course of official duty.
    (3) An implement of husbandry [farm machinery] may momentarily cross into a bicycle lane to permit other vehicles to overtake and pass the implement of husbandry.
    In addition, ORS 811.550 provides that vehicles may not be stopped or parked upon a bicycle lane with certain exceptions. The exceptions are contained in ORS 811.560 which include the following:
    1) Worker or student transport buses with flashing lights on; 2) Vehicles “stopped, standing, or parked momentarily to pick up
    or discharge a passenger”; 3) Maintenance or repair vehicles performing work on the roadway; 4) “When the driver’s disregard of the prohibitions is necessary to
    avoid conflict with other traffic”; 5) Vehicles under the direction of a police officer or traffic
    control device; 6) Disabled vehicles that cannot be moved; 7) Government employees releasing fish; 8) “Vehicles momentarily stopped to allow oncoming traffic to pass
    before making a right-hand or left-hand turn, or momentarily stopped in preparation or while negotiating an exit from the roadway.”
    28	BICYCLE LAWS
    The law that adds the last group does not mention its application to bicycles until 23 paragraphs into the statute.
    ORS 811.550 Places where stopping, standing and parking prohibited. This section establishes places where stopping, standing and parking a vehicle are prohibited for purposes of the penalties under ORS 811.555. Except as provided under an exemption in ORS 811.560, a person is in violation of ORS 811.555 if a person parks, stops or leaves standing a vehicle in any of the following places: (23) On a bicycle lane. Exemptions under ORS 811.560 are applicable to this subsection. (24) On a bicycle path. Exemptions under ORS 811.560 are applicable to this subsection.”
    Conflicts over the right-of-way in bicycle lanes
    When a motorist is entitled to drive across a bicycle lane, the motorist must still yield to a bicyclist occupying the lane just as any motorist must yield to another vehicle already occupying an adjacent lane. This is a difficult concept for many motorists, unfamiliar with the Rules of Road, to understand. First, the bicyclist is usually proceeding at a slower speed than the motorist, so, for example, if a motorist is going to be turning right and crossing the bicycle lane, it is difficult for many motorists to wait until a bicyclist they just passed is safely through the intersection before cutting across the bike lane. Bicyclists should not be passed by motorists who then cut the bicyclist off by squeezing a quick right turn in front of the approaching rider, the most frequent scenario for conflict.
    Parking maneuvers, entering driveways or parking lots, and exiting motorized vehicles are all areas of potential conflict over who has the right to be in the bicycle lane. ORS 811.050 makes it a Class B traffic infraction (up to a $360.00 fine) for a motorist to fail to yield to a rider in a bicycle lane. The technique motorists need to learn to use in driving near bicycle lanes is to drive so that bicyclists do not have to alter their speed in order to avoid a collision with the motorists. This means that motorists must wait for bicyclists to pass, slow down as they approach a bicyclist in the bike lane (such as in the right turn example), or stop in the lane of traffic with the turn signal on while waiting for the bike lane to clear before turning or parking. Other approaching motorists need to recognize and defer to the slowing or stopping motorist in order to avoid a potential collision that places everyone in danger.
    BIKE LANES REVISITED	29
    The bicycle lane is a hybrid invention encountered mostly in urban environments. Many motorists are not certain about the rules relating to bicycle lanes, and some motorists resent them (and bicyclists for that matter). There will be a motorist learning curve over the years that results in more drivers having confidence around bicycles and bicycle lanes. During the “early years” of the bicycle revolution, both bicy- clists and motorists need to recognize that we are trying something new that will ultimately make the streets safer, cleaner, and more user friendly for all of us.

    <h2>The New Law of Passing From A Bicyclists’ Perspective</h2>

    Bicyclists have complained for years about the former Oregon law that prohibited passing on the right when motorists and bike riders were sharing the same lane. The Bicycle Transportation Alliance Legislative Committee and the 2005 Oregon Legislature worked together to change the law so that passing on the right is allowed when it is safe under existing circumstances. The new law goes into effect with the rest of Oregon’s 2005 legislative changes in January of 2006.
    First, what is not different. The old law permitted passing on the right when a vehicle was in the same lane and turning left, so long as the following vehicle did not have to go off of the paved roadway in order to go around. The new law continues to allow this maneuver, which aids the smooth flow of traffic. Passing on the right in a bicycle lane (which is a separate lane from the regular traffic lane) is allowed at any time, even under the old law, just as passing on the right when there are two parallel traffic lines in the same direction on a highway is allowed.
    The “New” Law About Passing On The Right
    What has changed about passing on the right in Oregon is that the 2005 Legislature adopted the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA) Legislative Committee’s recommendations that certain safe maneuvers will improve the law for bicycle riders and help improve the flow of traffic. Senate Bill (SB) 938 was passed with a bipartisan effort in the Oregon House and Senate and signed by the Governor in late June 2005. The new law, while simple, makes a significant change for Oregon bicyclists. ORS 814.420 now provides as follows (the new matter is in bold below):
    31
    32
    BICYCLE LAWS
    Unsafe Passing on the Right.
    SECTION 1. ORS 811.415 is amended to read:
    811.415. (1) A person commits the offense of unsafe passing on the right if the person:
    (a) Drives a vehicle to overtake and pass upon the right of anoth- er vehicle at any time not permitted under this section. (b) Drives a vehicle to overtake and pass upon the right of anoth- er vehicle at any time by driving off the paved portion of the high- way.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a person may drive a vehicle to over- take and pass upon the right of another vehicle under any of the fol- lowing circumstances:
    (a) Overtaking and passing upon the right is permitted if: (A) The overtaken vehicle is making or the driver has signaled an intention to make a left turn; (B) The paved portion of the highway is of sufficient width to allow two or more lanes of vehicles to proceed lawfully in the same direction as the overtaking vehicle; and (C) The roadway ahead of the overtaking vehicle is unobstruct- ed for a sufficient distance to permit passage by the overtaking vehicle to be made in safety.
    (b) Overtaking and passing upon the right is permitted if the over- taken vehicle is proceeding along a roadway in the left lane of two or more clearly marked lanes allocated exclusively to vehicu- lar traffic moving in the same direction as the overtaking driver. (c) Overtaking and passing upon the right is permitted if the over- taking vehicle is a bicycle that may safely make the passage under the existing conditions.
    (3) The offense described in this section, unsafe passing on the right,
    is a Class B traffic violation.
    In application, the new law allows safe passing on the right which helps to make the flow of traffic more smooth, and keeps riders from being stuck while stopped in a line of exhaust spewing motor vehicles.
    What Has Not Changed under the “New” Law
    While the new law allows passing the right when it is safe to do so, it is still a violation of the passing law to engage in unsafe passing maneuvers. While it is a fact question in each situation, it is likely that judges and juries will have a dim view toward passing on the right when it occurs at reckless speeds on lane divider lines of multi-lane roadways, or when riders fail to cautiously approach cars stopped with
    THE NEW LAW OF PASSING FROM A BICYCLIST’S PERSEPECTIVE	33
    blinking turn signals waiting for the light to change. While the law does create a right of passage on the right side of the traffic lane, riders will have to help car drivers learn to drive around bicyclists using the right part of the lane. Fluid and dynamic utilization of the entire roadway requires full attention and constant scanning by drivers. A glance over the right shoulder is necessary for all movements that may cutoff a passing bicyclist on the right side.
    The old law was unfair to bike riders because few people even knew about the legal restriction on passing on the right and it was not until somebody got into an accident that the passing prohibition was used against them. The old law was unfair because it created a blanket prohi- bition against a riding maneuver which is used safely throughout the world by bicyclists. Further, the old law discriminated against bicycle riders because motorists were allowed to pass slower moving bicyclists in the same lane, but when the motorist slowed the bicycle riders were unable to then move forward, such as at a traffic light where there was a long line of stopped cars. The new law removes one more trap from the OregonVehicle Code and promotes a dynamic and fluid use of the traf- fic lanes akin to the cooperative sharing of the road encountered in oth- er countries where roads are not dominated by motor vehicles.
    Of course, bicycles are entitled to pass cars just like any other vehi- cle on streets without a bicycle lane. Note that ORS 811.410 prohibits overtaking vehicles from speeding up until they are completely passed. When bicyclists are passed by cars, such as on a rural two-lane black- top, the passing car frequently crosses the centerline of the roadway in order to give berth to the cyclists since the speed difference between the vehicles can be as much as 50 miles per hour. Bicyclists must recog- nize that if the pass takes the motorist over the centerline then the passing car must yield to vehicles coming in the opposite direction.
    Experienced bicyclists shudder when they sight a truck quickly approaching from the rear on a rural highway when another truck is coming in the opposite direction, such that all three vehicles have the chance of meeting on the same section of roadway. When necessary, the overtaking vehicle is supposed to slow down and pass the slower moving cyclist after the roadway is clear and unobstructed in the opposite lane.
    Bicyclists Deserve Additional Room on the Roadway
    Many bicyclists wonder why car drivers are so miserly with their relinquishment of a portion of the travel lane, and so reluctant to cross
    34	BICYCLE LAWS
    the center line in a roadway when it is unoccupied. While it is generally true that the Rules of the Road prohibit crossing the center line in no passing zones, there is an exception in ORS 811.420 allowing a vehicle to cross over the center line “when an obstruction or condition exists making it necessary to drive to the left of the center of the roadway.” Of course, the driver must yield to oncoming motorists, but if the roadway is clear, there is no reason that a motorist should be reluctant to move over to give a safe wide berth to bicyclists.
    One way we can teach drivers is through our own actions
    One exercise I sometimes enjoy when driving is to watch the vehi- cles ahead of me go around a bicyclist, usually giving the rider little room when they pass. Then when I go around the bicyclist, I give four feet of space to the bike rider and then watch my rearview mirror to see what happens. Most times, the following vehicles automatically end up following my lead if the opposite lane is clear, taking their cue from me about giving bicyclists room on the road. It says something good about human nature that when we follow each other like lemmings it is not always toward bad behavior, but sometimes toward improved behavior. The changes in the passing law are an important step in creating a legal environment in Oregon which takes bicyclists into account.

    <h2>Oregon Statute Makes Dangerous Storm Drains Illegal</h2>
    
    In years past, storm drains have presented a significant hazard for bicyclists. Many drains were designed with metal spaces in the direc- tion of travel that were wide enough to “eat” bicycle wheels. Newer designs have a crisscross pattern, eliminating the potential for getting a tire wedged into the structure, launching the unwary rider over the handlebars.
    The Oregon Revised Statutes contain a legal prohibition against dangerous storm grates that can be used by riders to nudge mainte- nance departments to install or redesign dangerous storm drains. Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 810.150 requires that storm drains be designed so that bicycles may pass safely:
    810.150. Drain construction; compliance with bicycle safety require- ments; guidelines. (1) Street drains, sewer drains, storm drains and other similar open- ings in a roadbed over which traffic must pass that are in any portion of a public way, highway, road, street, footpath or bicycle trail that is available for use by bicycle traffic shall be designed and installed, including any modification of existing drains, with grates or covers so that bicycle traffic may pass over the drains safely and without obstruction or interference.
    (2) The Department of Transportation shall adopt construction guide- lines for the design of public ways in accordance with this section. Limitations on the applicability of the guidelines are established under ORS 801.030.
    Unfortunately, the statute is modified by ORS 801.030 which “grandfathers” in “drains installed prior to 1975.” This means that old style drains may escape the reach of the statute as a matter of law. However, it is almost impossible to tell when a drain has been installed so, for advocacy purposes, it is probably best to assume that the drain
    35
    36	BICYCLE LAWS
    was installed after 1975, and is, therefore, subject to the prohibition on dangerous installations.
    Note also that the section applies not only to public ways that are part of a “highway, road or street” but also to a “foot path or bicycle trail.” This means that if the dangerous grate is in a location where bicycles may lawfully pass, it must be designed to be safe.
    Contemporary storm drains are designed to conform with design requirements that take bicycles into account. However, there are still old drains in existence which, like unexploded military ordinance, create a potential hazard for anyone passing over them. In addition, even properly designed storm drains can pose a hazard if the drain surface is installed below the pavement surface of the road.
    One of the techniques used by street departments to repair a crum- bling roadway is to install a new asphalt surface. A road surfacing machine removes the crumbling surface section of the old road and then new blacktop is installed. Sometimes this process occurs over and over again so that the surface of the roadway rises slightly with each application. However, when this technique is used, the storm drains located at the edge of the roadway must be raised to be flush with the new surface of the roadway. If the storm drain is left recessed at the old roadway level, it creates a hazard for bicyclists proceeding along the edge of the road. Storm drains and manhole covers in the main trav- eled portion of the roadway are typically raised with some sort of collar device to avoid a traffic hazard; but some storm drains at the edge of the roadway are not given the same careful treatment. It is important that roadways be designed, and upgraded, to take both motorized and non-motorized users into account, and the storm drain statute man- dates that all drains in any portion of the roadway over which bicyclists may legally travel must be safe.
    What to do to report a violation
    If you know of a storm drain that presents a potential hazard in vio- lation of the statute, call or write a letter to your local road maintenance department. Sometimes merely advising the maintenance department of their civic responsibility or the requirements of the statute may not be enough to make things happen. In these times fear of “liability” or a “potential lawsuit” is often used as an excuse for denying access to users of public and private facilities (“I’m sorry but we cannot let you go in there because if someone got hurt then we might get sued.”). You
    OREGON STATUTE MAKES DANGEROUS STORM DRAINS ILLEGAL	37
    can use the potential lawsuit phobia to actually make something good happen by letting maintenance departments know that if someone was hurt by a dangerous storm drain a lawyer could “cause trouble” for the city or county and then the taxpayers may have to pay for an injury. Make sure you send a copy of the letter to County Counsel or City Attorney’s Office to provide additional notice of the dangerous condi- tion.
    Regular commuters along stretches of road containing dangerous storm drains have probably learned over time to avoid hazards on their ride. However, the riders who are most likely going to be hurt are more occasional users. It is important, for the benefit of other riders who may be riding over unfamiliar terrain or at night, that regular riders of particular routes advocate for safe conditions. A sample letter advising of a drain problem is copied below. Note that the letter attempts to dis- cuss the importance of the thoroughfare for bicyclists. The tone should not be threatening or whiny, but authoritative.
    Road Operations &amp; Maintenance Re: Storm Drains Dear Sir/Madam:
    This letter is to advise you and to provide notice of a dangerous condition existing which violates the Oregon Revised Statutes.
    As you know, ______ is a major bicycle commuter thoroughfare for persons heading ____ and ____ alongside the ________. Bicycle traffic in ________ is fairly heavy and the road is quite narrow with a small paved shoulder. Because of the proximity to the ______, ______, _______, the roadway is heavily used by bicyclists.
    Unfortunately, there are at least ___ storm drains on the ___ side of ______ directly in front of _________ that ___________.
    ORS 810.150 requires that grates and drains be engineered such that bicycles can pass safely over them. These storm drains clearly do not meet this test and should be re-engineered to bring the drain up to the level of the roadway surface.
    If a bicyclist were to be injured as a result of colliding with one of these storm drains, it would likely result in a significant claim against _____________.
    Please provide me with your position in regard to this problem at your earliest opportunity. For your information, I am providing a copy of this letter to the office of the ______________ Counsel for their review.”
    38	BICYCLE LAWS
    Agencies in charge of maintenance for areas with dangerous haz- ards need to hear from bicyclists. Conditions are allowed to exist on roadway shoulders that would never be tolerated on the main section of the roadway. Often these dangers exist because maintenance depart- ments fail to realize that roadway shoulders are heavily used by bicy- clists. While the wheel you save may not be your own, it is very satisfy- ing to see roadway improvements resulting from your good efforts.

    <h2>Avoiding Typical Accidents</h2>
    Bicyclists seeking to avoid accidents are obliged to become highly experienced riders, or to become extremely well informed by taking a bicycle riding course such as one sponsored by bicycling organizations such as The League of American Bicyclists or Oregon’s Bicycle Transportation Alliance. There are a number of clear accident patterns to learn and prepare to avoid so as to reduce the chance of an injury accident.
    Collisions With Motorists
    Motorists all too frequently do not recognize bicycle riders as vehi- cles; not because they seek to avoid recognizing us (indeed, most motorists are made nervous by bicycle riders and because arguably more alert than they are for other types of non-motorized road users such as joggers and bladers) but because the bicycle is recognized as being somewhat “vehicle-like.” While there is definitely a love/hate relationship between motorists and bicyclists, any pathology in the relationship is not a factor in the great majority of accidents.
    Left Turning Motorists
    Most left-turn accident cases involve a bicyclist not in a bicycle lane who is hit by a motorist coming from the opposite direction who fails to see the bicyclist until it is too late. These are often serious accidents because of the closing forces from traveling in opposite directions. Accidents occurring where the bicyclist is riding at night without lights or was passing on the right of a line of stopped or slower cars without being in a bike lane provide the most frequently encountered liability problems from the bicyclists’ perspective. However, in the typical case, the failure to yield by the motorist is sufficient to establish liability. When these accidents result in lawsuits and go to court the usual legal problem relates to medical causation and damages rather than fault.
    39
    40	BICYCLE LAWS
    Survival Skills for Close Traffic
    Riding in close traffic requires heightened awareness in anticipating potential vehicle paths of travel. At some point, every experienced bicyclist learns to accept the fact that in approaching any intersection with cars, there is a point of no return after which the rider is so far into the intersection that there is little room for evasive bike handling. Up to this point, the rider is only committed to a path of travel within certain broad parameters and if a motorist suddenly decides to squeeze off a quick left turn, it is possible that there is still enough room in the intersection for a good bike handler to evade the car (unlike a collision between two cars where the sheer bulk of the car bodies fills all avail- able escape routes between the curbs in the intersection). Thinking about the potential paths of travel of other vehicles while approaching intersections is a lot of work. However, advanced riding technique requires development of this level of attention in order to entirely elim- inate manageable risks. Ultimately, however, (whether we are traveling as bicyclists, pedestrians, or motorists) we place ourselves at a point of no return, past that point if someone fails to recognize our superior right of way or maintain their vehicle under proper control, there is lit- tle we can do to change course to avoid an accident.
    Other Survival Skills
    Other non-riding factors are also involved in avoiding accidents. Conspicuity, (the safety concept responsible for color selection on highway signs and the clothes of flaggers and roadway workers) plays a role in forcing the attention of drivers onto approaching bicyclists. The usual hazard colors are best. You don’t have to worry about being con- fused with a car, motorcyclist, or any other larger object than yourself; choose colors associated with an emergency and you will be safest, albeit dressed somewhat like a fishing lure.
    The Law Requires Front Lights at Night
    Recognition that even a medium-performance lighting system (the law only requires that the front light be visible for 600 feet; good enough for a small flashlight beam) raises the chances of being seen at night or at twilight.
    AVOIDING TYPICAL ACCIDENTS	41
    Other Types of Common Accidents
    Collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles also occur in other scenarios, such as collisions at transition points where bicyclists are entering or crossing regular traffic lanes from sidewalks or bicycle lanes, crossing intersections in crosswalks, or intersections where a driver fails to yield to the bike rider. Again, the majority of these acci- dents involve situations where the motorist has failed to recognize the bicyclist as a vehicle and either turns into or directly in front of the bicycle rider.
    Accident Avoidance Riding Skills
    Defensive driving awareness coupled with knowledge of emergency accident avoidance techniques may decrease the chances of an injury accident. However, an old statistical rule of thumb is that the average rider will be involved in an accident about once in every seven years of riding. Knowledge of emergency avoidance techniques can go a long way toward avoiding accidents because there is so much room in which to maneuver in a typical intersection for a narrow bicycle. The League of American Bicyclist’s (LAB) Effective Cycling course has taught rid- ers these types of maneuvers for three decades or more.
    It is a little difficult to practice emergency maneuvers which neces- sarily involve taking the bike to the limit of its performance. Mountain bike riders usually learn how much front brake to apply without per- forming an “endo” over the handle bars, but on a road bike few riders know where the line is between maximum braking and a front flip.
    Car drivers have classes available at Portland International Raceway (PIR) which teach emergency avoidance maneuvers. For these classes, regular street cars are outfitted with adjustable wheeled outriggers. The outriggers can be raised or lowered, taking weight off of the tires of the car. The car is then driven in dry and wet pavement simulations, allow- ing the driver to experience tire and suspension performance at and beyond the point of loss of traction. Emergency braking and steering maneuvers require practice and some technique, such as turning into the direction of a skid, which may be counter intuitive, so these classes provide a safe “laboratory” for practice.
    While bicyclists do not have outriggers or specialized “training wheels” available, some people practice emergency maneuvers on a soft mowed grassy area. Since the front wheel provides over twice as much braking potential as the rear wheel, it is important to learn how to shift
    42	BICYCLE LAWS
    weight during emergency braking back behind the saddle and low on the bike without going over the handle bars. Many riders become com- placent and fail to use their front brakes sufficiently; and, the rear brake, particularly with a narrow high pressure tire, provides very little braking power before the rear tire breaks loose from the pavement and skids.
    Another technique that can be practiced and mastered is used by bicycle police officers to come to a sudden controlled stop and involves skidding the bike sideways, a maneuver many of us practiced with our coaster brakes when we were kids, causing great loss of rear tire life.
    A grassy area can also provide a good place to practice emergency turning maneuvers and explore how far the bicycle will turn before it begins to skid or flop over. The usual complement of hazard warnings must accompany any practice session since any accident, even on a grassy knoll can produce serious injury.
    Wear A Helmet
    It may go without saying that one of the few things we can do to improve our chances of avoiding serious injury in the event of an acci- dent is to wear a good helmet. Many serious accidents include large force impacts to the head. Dented and cracked helmets are frequently found at the scene of high energy accidents. Yet, many riders, including a number of elite level racers, object to wearing a helmet for reasons of aesthetics.
    Conclusion
    Defensive riding techniques allow bicyclists to avoid some acci- dents. Knowledge of most common scenarios that result in injuries combined with learning the basics about emergency avoidance maneu- vers may make a critical difference in whether or not an accident hap- pens. Maximize your chances of avoiding an accident by using lights at night, wearing bright colors, and always wear a helmet.

    PART II: BICYCLE RIDING ON SIDEWALKS
    Bicycles, Sidewalks And The Law
    As I bicycle in the Portland area, I often see bicyclists riding on the sidewalks. Sometimes bicyclists appear to be doing this to avoid traveling the wrong way on a one-way street. Other times they ride on the sidewalk because the road is particularly inhospitable to cyclists due to traffic patterns, the road surface or the lack of a suitable shoul- der. Do we cyclists have the right to ride on the sidewalk? What are the rules? How are the police reacting to bicyclists who choose to use the sidewalk? This article will answer your questions about bicyclists and sidewalks.
    Oregon Revised Statute 811.050 makes it a Class B traffic infrac- tion for a motorist to fail to yield the right of way to a bicyclist on a sidewalk, unless the bicyclist is in violation of another statute, ORS 814.410, which provides that a person commits the offense of “unsafe operation of a bicycle on a sidewalk” if the person:
    •	Suddenly leaves the curb or other place of safety and moves into the path of a vehicle, causing an immediate hazard.
    •	Fails to give an audible warning before passing a pedestrian while riding on the sidewalk.
    •	Fails to yield to all pedestrians on the sidewalk. •	Rides carelessly or in a manner that endangers others or
    endangers property. •	Rides at a speed greater than an ordinary walk when approaching
    or entering a crosswalk, driveway, curb cut or pedestrian ramp if
    a motor vehicle is approaching. Violation of ORS 814.410 is a class D traffic infraction for which
    the uniform fine is $90.00. In Portland’s “core,” and in other cities in Oregon, the rules are different. Gresham’s City Code prohibits bicy- clists from riding on any city sidewalk. Portland Ordinance 16.70.320E prohibits bicyclists from riding on sidewalks in the property bounded by and including S.W. Jefferson St., Front Avenue, N.W. Hoyt Street
    65
    66	BICYCLE RIDING ON SIDEWALKS
    and 13th Avenue, unless “to avoid a traffic hazard in the immediate area.” The maximum fine is an astonishingly high amount of $500.00. Motorists sometimes do not do a very good job of looking out for
    bicyclists or anticipating what they are going to do. That is why it is important for bicyclists to be prepared for the inattentive motorist, and to be prepared to stop quickly when using the sidewalk, even though by law the motorist is supposed to yield to the bicycle.
    The Portland police have “cracked down” on bicyclists who ride on sidewalks in downtown Portland in response to business owners’ con- cerns that bicyclists were disrupting pedestrian traffic and making sidewalks unsafe for pedestrians. The crackdown apparently began in late 1997, which was in response to business owners’ concerns that bicyclists were disrupting pedestrian traffic and making sidewalks unsafe for pedestrians. The downtown police precinct appears to have followed suit. The police say that they are not just cracking down on bicyclists, but are also citing people who violate other “livability” ordi- nances, such as those that regulate noise, driving on the bus mall and blocking driveways.
    Anecdotally, the police seem to agree that the fine in Portland is too high, and have at least in several instances suggested to bicyclists that they ask the traffic court judge to reduce the fine. It probably will do you no good to argue with the police officer and, in fact, may hurt another bicyclist’s chances of avoiding a ticket for the same behavior.
    If you are cited for riding on the sidewalk, consider appearing in court or writing a letter to the court explaining, if you have a good rea- son, why you were on the sidewalk in the first place. If you are cited in a city where the ordinance is not posted, impress on the court that, unlike Corvallis, where bicyclists are warned of the prohibition with signs, this city is not even warning bicyclists that riding on the sidewalk might result in what is to you, an extraordinarily large fine. Even if you were riding illegally on the sidewalk when cited, if you appear in traffic court and explain why it is that you felt you had no safe alternative but to ride on the sidewalk, the judge may reduce your fine.
    For now, if you ride your bicycle on the sidewalk — and that is your right anywhere in the state where doing so is not prohibited by ordinance — you need to know and obey the laws, and, if cited, be ready to pay the fine or argue in traffic court why you were riding on the sidewalk, and why your choice was reasonable or legal.

    PART III: HARASSMENT OF BICYCLISTS
    Harassment By Motorists – KnowYour Legal Rights
    One would think that with fewer bicyclists on the road during the wet winter months motorists would be more tolerant of our presence. However, perhaps a perverse dynamic is at work such that drivers with a malignant attitude toward bicyclists are more motivated to hassle a solitary cyclist on the road in front of them. In any event, we have seen a disturbing number of harassment incidents and this article is offered as a refresher on what you can do about harassment if you or a friend are an intended target.
    Harassment severity should determine your response
    If you are harassed by a motorist, you need to analyze the severity of the hazard created by the motorist’s actions, and gauge your own energy level for creating a considered response. A “considered response” is necessary because, while Oregonians are proud to point out that we do not shoot each other over parking spaces, nevertheless, provoking a motorist into an uncontrolled confrontation is stupid and dangerous. If someone endangers you by violating the law, it is proba- bly not worth taking them to traffic court for some technical violation of the Rules of the Road. Instead, translate your anger into writing a letter. Memorize their license plate number, obtain their name and address from the Department of MotorVehicles (DMV) (an easy pro- cedure, just call the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA) or our office). Then write the driver, or better, the driver’s employer if they are in a work vehicle, letting them know what the law provides regard- ing your right to use the roadway, citation to the traffic code violations they committed in your presence, how their conduct made you afraid and angry, and finally, that you are going to wait until you hear from them before you decide about whether or not you will pursue the
    77
    78	HARASSMENT OF BICYCLISTS
    matter with a citation for a moving violation in traffic court. Writing the letter is therapeutic, and in most cases you will hear from the wor- ried motorist. While you may not get a direct apology, your follow up provides an excellent learning experience for most drivers, who are keenly aware of the effect a potential traffic code conviction will have upon their insurance rates and driving record.
    A recent example illustrates the value of the letter writing approach. A Portland bicyclist received a “close shave” from a small pickup while riding along Front Avenue near Waterfront Park. He not- ed the license number, obtained the registered owner’s name through DMV, and then, since the incident was not serious enough to merit a criminal prosecution, wrote a letter along the lines outlined above to the motorist. Shortly afterward he received a long rambling letter back from the motorist, who claimed that he was not the driver, some mis- take must have been made, but then he went on at length in providing an elaborate legal justification for the actions of the driver of the pickup truck, interspersing his argument with frequent biblical and legal cita- tions. While the driver may have been unwilling to admit his involve- ment, his response shows that the message was received loud and clear.
    However, if you were truly placed in danger, or injured, or if the motorist behaved in an outrageous manner, then you owe it to yourself, and to other riders, to pursue the matter further.
    It is not worth going to traffic or district court, or bothering police agencies over any incident which is not sufficiently serious to justify charging one of the following traffic offenses or misdemeanor crimes:
    •	Assault IV • Menacing •	Reckless Endangerment • Harassment •	Reckless Driving •	Careless Driving
    Harassment by motorists—know your legal rights
    Each of these offenses involves serious and dangerous driving misbehavior.
    KNOW YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS	79
    What do I do?
    If your harassment by a motorist is serious enough to take to court, you will have to be able to identify the driver, the vehicle, and usually the license plate number.
    Call the police
    Tell them what happened and what laws were broken by the motorist. Hopefully, law enforcement will be sympathetic and will have sufficient time to investigate and cite or arrest the driver. However, if the police are not responsive to your initial contact, do not give up. Call the BTA or our office, and we will help you to initiate a prosecution.
    Be aware that even though the Motor Vehicle Code gives you a right equal to that of any motorist to use the roadway, in the eyes of many people, bicycles are a toy and should always get out of the way of motorists. Part of your job as a bicyclist in the court system will be to educate everyone you contact about how you are exercising your legal rights to share the roadway with automobiles, and that on the day you were harassed you were also recognizing and abiding by your responsi- bilities as a roadway user.
    If any motorist spits on you, throws something out of a vehicle in your direction, pretends they are going to run you off of the road or hit you, swerves their vehicle in a menacing manner toward you on your bike, or touches you or your bicycle in any way, then it is important for you to prosecute them, even if you are not hurt. The reason is that per- petrators of crimes usually get away without being identified or appre- hended. If you are a victim of harassment by a driver, it is likely that your incident is one of many and, if you do nothing, the next time the driver goes after another bicyclist a serious injury may result.
    Finally...
    You do not need to become a bicycle militia member in order to stand up for your legal rights. Motorist harassment of bicyclists is a serious problem and is an event which intimidates riders from enjoying road riding. Since before the turn of the century, the League of American Wheelmen, now League of American Bicyclists, has led the fight for shared, safe roads for bicycle riders. A psychological profile of our culture would reveal that there is an identifiable percentage of motorists who cannot stand to see a bicycle rider in the lane of traffic in front of their vehicles without honking or in some other manner com-
    80	HARASSMENT OF BICYCLISTS
    municating their disapproval. Whether our response is a simple polite letter with an invitation for an apology, or a full scale criminal prosecu- tion depends upon the severity of the hazard created by the motorist’s behavior. If you are involved in an incident and do not get cooperation from law enforcement in initiating a prosecution, attend one of our free legal clinics and we will show you how to get started. While being spit at or sworn at is a foul form of interference with an otherwise nice day, on the other hand, arrest for a serious traffic offense is a good, and legal, way to even the score.

    PART IV: CITIZEN INITIATED VIOLATION PROSECUTION
    Citizen InitiatedViolation Prosecution
    What and Why
    Encourage injured riders to create strong enforcement of bicyclist rights to the road in injury accidents by taking things into their own hands and using laws already on the books to charge and convict driv- ers in court for violation of the Rules of the Road.
    Law enforcement agencies do not have the resources or the legal understanding of laws relating to bicycles from a bicyclist perspective to investigate and issue citations for traffic law violations in most injury accidents. For example, in Portland, Oregon’s most populous city known for its friendly attitude toward bike riders, city police maintain a departmental policy of facilitating exchange of information between the parties to an accident, but not investigating or issuing citations in traffic accidents unless one of the parties is placed into the area hospital Trauma system or the driver has a warrant or a suspended license. The Trauma system only takes the most serious injuries; entry triggers a police investigation including witness accounts and a scene diagram. However many bicycle accidents involve high energy transfers and seri- ous injuries; yet no police investigation is provided—often an unpleas- ant surprise to many healing bike riders who later find out that it is their word against the motorist when it comes time to make an insur- ance claim.
    Background
    Police spokesmen have stated in the past that the Oregon statutes prohibit citation unless the cop witnesses commission of the offense. This is not technically correct because the law (ORS 810.410 (4) allows a police officer to issue a citation after an accident based on their own after the fact personal investigation. However, even if a police investi- gation of the accident is available, non-motorized roadway users may still not like the result because some police officers do not see these
    85
    86	CITIZEN INITIATED VIOLATION PROSECUTION
    user groups as legitimate and rightful roadway users. This paternalistic attitude fails to accord full legal rights to the most vulnerable roadway users, those who because of their vulnerability (since they are not encased in sheet metal) most need vigilant protection of the law.
    But, bicyclists must consider fully the high costs associated with more intensive traffic accident investigation by police. After all, the insurance adjuster/attorney system serve pretty well in sorting out who is at fault in most accidents. Police officers’ primary mission is to pro- tect public safety; in the great majority of collisions fault is clear and investigation of accidents is more appropriately performed by claim adjusters in insurance companies. Regardless of where one draws the line, there is a point after which it is just more important for a cop to be working on a criminal case than answering a radio call to conduct a traffic investigation for an intersection collision.
    We Can Do It Ourselves
    And, without requiring any change in law or policy, Oregon bicy- clists already have the legal tools to initiate prosecution of traffic law breakers. Oregon law allows a citizen to initiate traffic violation prose- cutions in state court, AND to have police help (per Oregon statute). After the initial report is taken and the citizen signs the Oregon Uniform Citation and Complaint, the completed paperwork is served on the bad driver summoning them to traffic court to face the charges in a non-jury trial in front of a traffic judge. The complaining citizen gives an informal presentation of the case, the judge hears evidence and testimony, and then decides. If convicted the bad driver receives a con- viction and fine for a moving violation which is no different than one from a ticket issued by a police officer.
    The process, known as a citizen “Initiation of Violation Proceeding” is important for bicyclists – we usually get banged up the most in a bike-car collision. Too many of these wrecks occur because drivers fail to yield to us or give us our legal share of the road. These drivers are among the most dangerous drivers on the road and it is important that their driving records reflect it. Also, Insurance adjusters frequently fail to give adequate recognition to bicyclist legal rights. Whether ignorant of the law or just hostile to bike riders, many insur- ance adjusters see a bike collision case and instinctively favor their insured motorist. Since only the most serious collisions involve law enforcement accident investigation, the bike rider who is hurt after a
    CITIZEN INITIATED VIOLATION PROSECUTION	87
    clear cut violation of the traffic law by a motorist is often disappointed to learn that the driver (who was clearly admitting fault at the scene) is now claiming the bicyclist was at fault. On the other hand if the official court record contains a citation and traffic court conviction of the driv- er, then the insurance adjuster will be hard pressed to ignore the true liability picture.
    Follow The Recipe
    The Oregon statute is detailed and task specific. It includes every step of the process. The exact text is printed below because it may be necessary to show it to the authorities. Few law enforcement personnel are likely to have direct experience with the process when it is initiated by a citizen; but most officers are very familiar with the Oregon Uniform Citation and Complaint form (the statewide “ticket book” ). The law requires that the officer facilitate the process. If you dead-end with the officer who first responds then try the department non-emer- gency and/or hit and run traffic phone number. In rural areas, state police and sheriff officers share jurisdiction. The gravity of any injury and seriousness of the motorist’s traffic violation will greatly influence the officer’s response. Filing these cases over petty traffic standoffs is going to stress a tax-poor law enforcement and court system struggling to contain Oregon’s dangerous traffic offenders. But in bike-car colli- sions resulting in injury in which the driver commits a clear violation of the traffic laws the bike rider should consider whether a traffic viola- tion conviction is an option that will be important later to clarify the legal cause of the accident and to make a legal record of the driver’s law violation.
    How to Initiate a Citizen Initiated Violation Prosecution (Yourself )
    1. Learn the lingo and read ORS 153.058 so you can explain it to someone who has never heard of it and will likely not believe such an unheard of procedure exists until you actually show them the law in their copy of their traffic statute book. If you cannot succeed up to this point call our office or the Bicycle Transportation Alliance and see if you can find a volunteer to explain it. The statute has been on the books long enough and the wording is clear enough that at some point you will find someone who thinks it is probably their job to deal with you. It may require the following (and in this order):
    88	CITIZEN INITIATED VIOLATION PROSECUTION
    Contact the officer who investigated your accident or facilitated exchange of traffic accident information, any other officer involved in your accident, the shift sergeant for that unit on that shift at the time of your accident, the commander for the unit, the executive officer’s office (Chief, Sheriff, whatever), the District Attorney’s office in your county, the City Attorney office in your city, the traffic department clerk in your local courthouse, or just about any person willing to speak with you about it near a courthouse or police station and show them the statute and this article. If they don’t know about the process but are willing to ask someone about it you will probably succeed in getting your case started if you are willing to allow the process to lumber up to speed AND
    2. Once you get a law enforcement officer willing to commence your violation proceeding then work through the process with them. They are supposed to create and send a summary of a complaint (which you may be required to swear to and sign), to the clerk’s office for issuance of a summons. The Oregon Uniform Traffic Citation and Complaint Form may be what most officers choose for issuance of the case. If you are unable to find someone willing to commence your prosecution then you may want to call our office or the BTA to help get things going. Multnomah County and Portland county and city traffic system staffers know about this process and will help another jurisdiction trying to fol- low the law and allow citizens to exercise their legal rights.
    If an unhelpful person points out that ORS 153.058 says “A person other than an enforcement officer ’may’ commence a violation proceed- ing...”so as to defeat your effort you must point out that the statute does not allow ANY discretion by the officer; the case MUST be com- menced once the citizen’s complaint is lodged. Further, the court has no discretion in issuing the summons as ORS 153.058 clearly states “the court ’shall’ issue a summons to be delivered...”. There is some discretion provided to the court to amend or dismiss a complaint, but issuance of properly presented complaints should not be opposed.
    3. Ask the officer who issued your case to help you find out about how to present your case. As in traffic court you will be in the position usually occupied by the officer who wrote the ticket. Identification of the driver and presentation of evidence can be handled by you and your witnesses. The police or courts will help you issue subpoenas to other witnesses in advance of court. If you do not feel like you will be able to present your case then ask for help from the police officer or a friend;

    PART V: ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    What To Do If You’re In An Accident
    What should you do if you are in a collision with a motor vehicle? First, Be Prepared! While the odds may be pretty good that you will never be involved in an accident there are several tips you can follow which will make any accident less of a disruption in your life. An understanding of the fundamentals of insurance, medical services, and the legal system will help you later after your accident. This article is a very basic primer on these areas.
    If you are in an accident
    If you do get in a wreck with an automobile on your bicycle, make sure that you obtain complete and accurate information about the auto- mobile driver. It is an unfortunate fact of modern life that some people with driving and insurance problems carry false identification. Make sure that the driver shows you an official document such as a driver license or other photo ID as well as a certificate of current insurance coverage before they leave the scene of the accident. If they will not do so, then call the police.
    Persons involved in an accident need to know the law. It is an unfortunate fact that there are so many accidents involving hit and run drivers that law enforcement agencies are overrun. Generally, limited law enforcement resources can only be expended on the most serious injury accident cases. However, the persistent hit and run victim will get further in the system than a person who makes one call and gives up. Oregon law requires that a driver or vehicle owner must complete an accident report on a Department of Transportation Accident Report form within 72 hours of an accident which results in injury or property damage in excess of $1,000.
    Even accident witnesses have certain legal duties. ORS 811.715 requires that witnesses to an accident that results in injury or death to any person or damage to a vehicle must furnish to the driver or injured
    91
    92	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    persons the true name and address of the witness. This means that you have a right to demand, (with the legal authority to have the person cit- ed if they fail to comply and you are lucky enough to have a police offi- cer arrive at the scene to cite them) that available witnesses provide you with information so that you can have a witness later to testify about what they saw in the accident. Because some people are unwilling to become involved in the aftermath of an accident, letting them know that failure to comply is a traffic offense may be a positive encourage- ment to do the right thing.
    While few people know about the duties required at the scene of an accident for drivers, the law is very specific in requiring that whether there is an injury or only property damage the driver of a vehicle must “immediately stop” at the scene or as close to the scene as possible. The driver must remain at the scene of the accident until they have provid- ed “the name and address of the driver and the registration number of the vehicle and the name and address of any other occupants of the vehicle.” ORS 811.700. The driver must also exhibit their driver’s license documents and, if there is no driver in a vehicle hit in an acci- dent, a written notice providing the name and address of the driver and a statement of the accident circumstances must be left in a “conspicu- ous place” in the vehicle.Violation of the law if there is property dam- age is a Class A Misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail.
    If a person is injured in an accident, failure to follow the require- ments is stepped up to a felony (Class C Felony, maximum penalty 5 years in jail). The other driver must provide “reasonable assistance” including making arrangements for conveying the injured party to a place providing medical treatment. The requirement for stopping at the scene also applies to an accident which results in injury to an ani- mal; in that case, the driver must report the injury to the animal’s own- er or if unable to do so, to a police officer. ORS 811.710.
    Many people think that calling the police will result in investigation and preparation of a police report. However, unless it is apparent to the responding police that there has been an injury in the accident they will usually not prepare a report, but instead will merely assist in exchange of information. Many serious injuries are not visible at the scene of an accident when a bicyclist’s adrenaline is flowing and there is the usual confusion about what to do next. If possible, return to the scene or send a friend with a camera and take photographs of skid marks, glass, or marks on the road showing point of impact, direction,
    WHAT TO DO IF YOU’RE IN AN ACCIDENT	93
    speed, or force. Try to document what the conditions were and how the accident happened. Time after time, I have seen clients outraged and disappointed when a motorist who freely admitted to being at fault at the scene later changed his or her story in an attempt to shift fault to the bicycle rider.
    Medical treatment
    If you have any question at all about whether or not you are injured, you should immediately go to an emergency room or get in to see your regular doctor. Many internal injuries, including closed head brain injuries, as well as soft tissue neck and back injuries are not fully appre- ciated by the injured person until some time has passed since the acci- dent. It is important that you document your injuries so that later, if need be, you can show through medical proof that your injuries were caused by the accident.
    Bicycle riders need insurance
    Most people do not realize that their automobile insurance policy also covers them while they are riding a bicycle. This is important for bicyclists, as “insurance consumers,” because everyone who has an automobile insurance policy is paying part of each premium dollar toward coverage that will apply if the insured person is injured as a pedestrian or bicyclist.
    For example, if you are hit on your road bike by an uninsured drunk driver one afternoon while you are on a training ride and seri- ously injured, it is important to realize that your own automobile insur- ance will provide two types of coverage for you. First, Personal Injury Protection (PIP) will pay for your medical bills and loss of income. PIP is a part of your own policy and will apply in every bicycle accident regardless of whether or not the other person is insured, and regardless of whose fault caused the accident. It is “No fault” coverage. “No fault” means that even if an accident is your fault, PIP protection will cover you. Even if you have no car insurance because you are not a car owner, you may be covered by the car insurance policy for your par- ents, spouse or your employer.
    The second type of applicable coverage is Uninsured (UM), Underinsured (UIM) Motorist Coverage, a legally required part of every automobile insurance policy. UM/UIM may provide an impor- tant safety net for riders whose injuries are a result of the fault of anoth-
    94	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    er person who has no insurance, or insufficient insurance to cover the damages resulting from the accident. UM/UIM coverage may pay not only for medical services and wage loss, but also for pain and suffering, interference with activities, future impairment of earning capacity and punitive (or punishment) damages.
    All bicyclists should have some sort of insurance coverage; serious- ly consider raising the limits of PIP (statutory minimum of $15,000 for medical and up to $15,000 for wage loss) and UM/UIM (statutory minimum $25,000) coverage above the minimum amounts. If you shop for insurance, you will discover that the cost per dollar of coverage is relatively inexpensive once you get above the minimum coverage amounts. If you are ever unlucky enough to get seriously hurt, you will be greatly relieved if you at least have adequate insurance to cover your damages.
    It will never happen to me
    Most people like to live their lives as if tragedy is not around the next corner. Studies have shown that people with a positive mental attitude are less likely to be accident prone and have better longevity than the perpetually worried. However, the experienced cyclist crashes an average of once every 8,000 miles of riding, or once in every 800 hours of riding (if you average around 10 miles per hour). This is not representative of the number of accidents involving injuries, which is much lower.
    However, for some people who cannot get a driver’s license due to mental, legal, or substance addiction problems, bicycle riding is one step above walking as the transportation option of last resort. The diffi- culty of getting and keeping a driver’s license, maintaining mandatory insurance, and the high cost of car ownership, explains the findings in a recent study conducted by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Injury Prevention Center which revealed that one in three bicyclists involved in fatal accidents had been drinking and nearly a fourth had a blood alcohol level over the legal limit.
    The only advantage to drinking and driving a bicycle instead of a car is that at least when a bicyclist crashes the resulting damage is usu- ally limited to the bicyclist. People who think that they are immune from arrest for DUII on a bicycle are wrong; under Oregon law a bicy- cle rider can be cited for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants just like a motorist.
    WHAT TO DO IF YOU’RE IN AN ACCIDENT	95
    Should I handle my own case?
    If you are seriously injured and the other driver is at fault and insured, it is likely that you will receive solicitation letters, “courtesy copies” of the police report, and even refrigerator magnets (argh) from lawyers who want to represent you. Remember, lawyer services are like any other personal service — be an educated consumer, make your selection carefully after learning about lawyers who come highly rec- ommended by people you trust. If your accident involves minor injury or property damage, it will be more difficult to attract excellent coun- sel. If you have an accident that is clearly the fault of the other party and don’t mind the hassle of birddogging your claim, then go for it and save the money (usually one-third) you would otherwise pay for a lawyer. If you do decide to go it alone, there are resources available. My law firm, in conjunction with Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA), has conducted legal clinics for bike riders trying to learn their legal rights since 1995. Our goal is to provide information that riders need to know about the legal system. Call the BTA at (503) 226-0276, or email info@bta4bikes.org for the date of the next clinic. Our office has also posted a number of Oregon laws and information on our web site. Check it out. You may find the text of the law that applies to your case at http://www.stc-law.com.
    The law regarding time limits is complicated and unforgiving; a through discussion is beyond the scope of this basic advice, but gener- ally in Oregon the statute of limitations in a negligence action is two years, and a tort claim must be made within 180 days of the accident against any public body, including Tri-Met or other semi-private com- panies. However, there are a number of exceptions and special rules, such as an extension of time for minors. If you decide to handle your accident case for yourself ask the claim adjuster to put in writing what legal timelines are applicable to your claim.
    Why am I being treated this way?
    After your accident, you feel like a victim. For some people, dealing with the other driver, medical services and insurance is smooth and uneventful. But many people are shocked when the expected “benefit delivery system” turns out to be a “benefit denial system.” Every injured rider is entitled to be treated with respect and courtesy. Questions about insurance coverage, medical services costs and avail- able benefits should be answered fully and without hesitation, and no
    96	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    person should be pressured to settle their claim. If you do not have the type of positive experience described above, something is wrong, and you should discuss these issues with a trusted friend or family member, or consult with an attorney. In any event, as an accident victim you have a right not to be pushed around by the system which exists to help you recover from your injuries; no one should be allowed to add insult to your injuries.
    PART IV: ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    Accidents That Result In Property Damage
    Fortunately, most bicycle accidents do not result in personal injuries. Instead, wheels get bent, helmets scraped (you did have your helmet on didn’t you?) and, if the accident is the motorist’s fault, a “property damage” claim is made against an insurance company. For the bicyclist, property damage claims are frustrating. Few lawyers are interested in representing a bicyclist whose claim involves a few hun- dred dollars. Consequently, bicyclists with little or no experience in legal matters find themselves advocating for damages with experienced claims adjusters. Since the amount involved is usually small, the bicy- clist ends up appealing to the claims adjuster’s sense of fairness. Most claims adjusters are not experienced riders and they are frequently shocked by the costs of bicycle repair and parts.
    Further, property damages are not recoverable unless the motorist is more than 50 percent at fault, because Oregon’s law (unlike the law of some other western states) requires that a potential defendant pay their percentage of fault only if their fault is greater than that of the bicyclist. This means that if the bicyclist is 51 percent at fault and a motorist is 49 percent at fault, the motorist completely escapes finan- cial responsibility.
    Since the claims adjuster’s job is to pay as little as possible on a claim, any fault arguably attributable to the bicyclist will be pointed out as a reason to reduce the amount paid. It is essential during these discussions that a bicyclist know the basic Rules of the Road. If possible, be prepared to cite actual Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) numbers.
    The law relating to property damage claims is technical. Many people believe that they should receive the amount of money they will need to replace their damaged property. Unfortunately, that is not the law. Instead, the bicyclist is entitled to the amount of money that is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the property
    97
    98	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    immediately before, and immediately after, the occurrence. This is called the diminution in property value.
    Bicycles depreciate rapidly and often the market value of a used bicycle is considerably less than its original purchase price. In order to establish market value, it is best to take your bicycle to a bike shop and get the following estimates:
    •	Value of the bicycle in the condition it was in immediately before the accident. In other words, the appraisal should be an appraisal of the bicycle the same year and model as your bicycle in the condition your bicycle was before the collision. It is sometimes difficult to find an employee at a shop who can perform this appraisal because most bike shops only sell new bikes. If you are having trouble, call around and find the name of a bike shop that sells used bicycles.
    •	Cost of repair of the bicycle. Do this even if you are certain the bicycle is beyond repair.
    •	Value of the bicycle in the condition it was in immediately after the accident. This amount is usually very low; what market value is there for a damaged bike?
    The claims adjuster will almost certainly call the shop to verify your figures. If your bike is “totaled” the adjuster will want to pay the value of your bicycle before the accident minus its salvage value. Frequently, bicycles have little or no salvage value. If you have a partic- ular attachment to some of the components, such as that Terry saddle or that wonderful old Campagnolo crankset, let the adjuster know and they will frequently be willing to let you have these parts. It has been my experience that the adjuster will usually recognize that a bike has no salvage value and allow you to keep the damaged bike if it is indeed totaled. On the other hand, if the bicycle can be fixed, it is up to you whether you want to fix the bike or not. You are not entitled to receive more money because your bicycle had a particularly high sentimental value. However, if your bicycle was a rare bicycle, and was, therefore, of an unusually high monetary value, you are entitled to receive that greater value if it is damaged or destroyed. Remember, the diminution in value of the bicycle may be much less than it would actually take to fix the bike. The law states that the person responsible for the damage need only pay the loss in value, not the cost of repair.
    Bicyclists are frequently anxious to have their damaged bicycles repaired as soon as possible after an accident. The Oregon statute of
    ACCIDENTS THAT RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE	99
    limitations for property damage claims caused by negligence is two years unless the defendant is an agent for a public entity, in which case written notice of a claim must be provided to the appropriate authority within 180 days after the accident. In serious injury cases, it can be a year or more before the person has recovered enough to know what if any permanent physical impairments may have resulted; however, property damage claims can be resolved immediately after the accident. There is no tactical reason to wait to resolve the property damage claim, and if a bicyclist also suffered physical injuries any release of claims signed by the rider can be limited to property damage only so that the personal injuries may be pursued at a later time within the statute of limitations.
    Sometimes riders are discouraged because the responsible driver’s insurance company fails to promptly pay on the property damage claim. In auto v. auto cases, property damage claims get settled promptly because claims adjusters are accustomed to providing a rental car while the damaged vehicle is in the shop getting fixed. The same law applies to bicycles – the bicycle rider is entitled to a rental vehicle for the time it takes to get the damaged bicycle fixed and serviceable again. One tip for adding speed to the property damage disposition is to have the quote at the bicycle shop include the cost of a comparable rental bicycle by the day, week, and month so that the rider can let the adjuster know how the cost of delay is going to be transferred to the insurance company.
    The same rules apply for other personal items such as helmet, pan- niers, clothing, and other personal property. If the clothing is new and you still have a receipt, it will be helpful for the bike shop in making an appraisal. If the property is older, the shop will need to know when you purchased it and the condition it was in prior to the collision. Finally, it is important that you save all property damaged so that you can show it to the adjuster if asked.
    We frequently hear from angry bicyclists who feel that they are not being dealt with fairly in determining who was at fault in the acci- dent, or the value of damaged property. Few bicyclists are willing to go to small claims court to advocate for themselves. Unfortunately, this means that riders frequently grudgingly accept “low ball” offers to set- tle property damage claims.
    One tool that does exist for bicyclists is a law that gives a victim a negotiating edge. ORS 20.080 provides that in claims for less than
    100	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    $5,500 if a ten-day demand letter is sent to the responsible party and is not paid, and the victim gets a lawyer and files a successful lawsuit, the responsible party has to pay the amount originally owed, plus attorney fees and costs. In a simple property damage claim the attorney fees and costs could total several thousand dollars. If a bicycle rider is in negoti- ations and is being treated unfairly, it will probably be of assistance to mention this law because if the bicyclist has to go out and hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit and wins the case then the amount awarded as costs and fees may very well exceed the amount owed in the first place. The statutory provision is contained in its entirety below:
    ORS 20.080 Attorney fees in actions for damages for personal or property injury. (1) In any action for damages for an injury or wrong to the person or property, or both, of another where the amount pleaded is $5,500 or less, and the plaintiff prevails in the action, there shall be taxed and allowed to the plaintiff, at trial and on appeal, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the action, if the court finds that written demand for the payment of such claim was made on the defendant not less than 10 days before the com- mencement of the action or the filing of a formal complaint... (2) If the defendant pleads a counterclaim, not to exceed $5,500, and the defendant prevails in the action, there shall be taxed and allowed to the defendant, at trial and on appeal, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the counterclaim.
    Property damage claims can be very frustrating for riders who are trying to represent themselves to get a fair recovery for their damaged equipment. Knowledge of the law helps to make the process a little eas- ier, but, in the final analysis, fair payment on damaged property claims requires a willingness to spend the time necessary to present the proof of loss, and persevere through negotiations to obtain fair payment.
    PART IV: ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    Accidents and Insurance
    All too often a bicyclist is seriously injured in an accident caused by a negligent driver and later investigation reveals that the motorist was uninsured, sometimes leaving the bicyclist without any insurance bene- fits. A recent example may help illustrate the point. On August 11, 1998, Jan Conner and Marvin Rambo (at the time the President of Portland Wheelman bicycling club) were run down by a drunk driver who swerved his sport utility vehicle into the bike lane on Airport Way, throwing Marvin 80 feet and Jan about 45 feet upon impact. The driver then sped away on a flat tire leaving the bicyclists bleeding along the side of the road. After a one and a half year long police investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, convicted by a jury of drunk driving and hit and run, then sentenced to 12 years in prison. Our office filed a negligence lawsuit against the driver for the injuries suffered by the bicycle riders. In the “discovery” stage of the lawsuit, we found out that the driver’s insurance had been canceled for nonpayment. Another potentially applicable insurance liability policy had expired one day before the accident. The bicyclists were left with serious permanent physical injuries and a “judgment proof ” incarcerated driver without insurance or any remedy.
    All too often, serious accidents are caused by people who are irre- sponsible drivers without insurance. However, there are two types of insurance bicyclists who are also automobile drivers can obtain in order to protect themselves.
    Personal Injury Protection
    Every Oregon motorist’s insurance policy contains Personal Injury Protection (also known as “PIP”). PIP provides certain minimum cov- erages and can be “stacked,” meaning that when more than one policy is applicable the benefits accumulate for the benefit of the claimant. The Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) contain certain statutory mini- mums for PIP coverage which include up to $15,000.00 for medical
    101
    102	ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    expenses and one year of wage loss up to $30.00 per day. PIP is “no- fault,” in that an injured party may make a claim against the policy regardless of who was at fault in the accident.
    Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
    The second type is uninsured (UM) or underinsured (UIM) motorist coverage, insuring for all sums the uninsured “shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death caused by acci- dent and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an unin- sured motor vehicle” (ORS 742.500). UM or UIM coverage provides coverage as if the uninsured driver had a liability insurance policy. The injured person makes a claim against his or her own insurance policy for their damages. In the case of a serious accident caused by an unin- sured driver or underinsured driver, UM or UIM coverage is the best protection for an injured rider. While the Oregon statutory minimum is $25,000.00, with today’s high medical costs it is advisable to have at least four times that amount. As with most insurance purchases, the higher ranges of insurance coverage provide more insurance for fewer dollars above the statutory minimum, so higher limit policies are usual- ly a very good deal for the dollar. UM and UIM coverage applies to bicyclists, so long as an accident is the fault of an uninsured or under- insured driver.
    The legal relationship between the various types of coverage in a serious accident is quite complex. In some instances, coverage may be denied or limited depending upon policy language and benefit amounts. Seek professional assistance from a lawyer knowledgeable about insurance claims before you accept any representations about whether an accident is covered by a particular insurance policy.
    Frequently, serious accidents are caused by uninsured or underin- sured drivers. Even if an accident is caused by the bicyclist, PIP cover- age (which is no-fault) will apply to provide some benefits. Bicyclists would be well advised to purchase UM or UIM policies with high poli- cy limits to protect themselves from major injuries caused by financial- ly irresponsible drivers.

    PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION BENEFITS
    742.520 Personal injury protection benefits for motor vehicle liability policies; applicability; definitions for ORS 742.520 to 742.542. Every motor vehicle liability policy issued for delivery in this state that covers any private passenger motor vehicle shall provide person- al injury protection benefits to the person insured thereunder, mem- bers of that person’s family residing in the same household, children not related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption who are residing in the same household as the insured and being reared as the insured’s own, passengers occupying the insured motor vehicle and pedestrians struck by the insured motor vehicle. “Personal injury protection benefits” means the benefits described in this section and ORS 742.524 and 742.530.
    (2) Personal injury protection benefits apply to a person’s injury or death resulting:
    (a) In the case of the person insured under the policy and mem- bers of that person’s family residing in the same household, from the use, occupancy or maintenance of any motor vehicle, except the following vehicles:
    (A) A motor vehicle, including a motorcycle or moped, that is owned or furnished or available for regular use by any of such persons and that is not described in the policy; (B) A motorcycle or moped which is not owned by any of such persons, but this exclusion applies only when the injury or death results from such person’s operating or riding upon the motorcycle or moped; and
    (C) A motor vehicle not included in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and not a private passenger motor vehicle. However, this exclusion applies only when the injury or death results from such person’s operating or occupying the motor vehicle.
    (b) In the case of a passenger occupying or a pedestrian struck by the insured motor vehicle, from the use, occupancy or mainte- nance of the vehicle.

    ACCIDENTS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE
    (3) Personal injury protection benefits consist of payments for expenses, loss of income and loss of essential services as provided in ORS 742.524. (4) An insurer shall pay all personal injury protection benefits prompt- ly after proof of loss has been submitted to the insurer. (5) The potential existence of a cause of action in tort does not relieve an insurer from the duty to pay personal injury protection benefits. (6) Disputes between insurers and beneficiaries about the amount of personal injury protection benefits, or about the denial of personal injury protection benefits, shall be decided by arbitration if mutually agreed to at the time of the dispute. (7) As used in ORS 742.520 to 742.542: (a) “Motor vehicle” means a self-propelled land motor vehicle or trail-
    er, other than: (A) A farm type tractor or other self-propelled equipment designed for use principally off public roads, while not upon public roads; (B) A vehicle operated on rails or crawler-treads; or (C) A vehicle located for use as a residence or premises.
    (b) “Motorcycle” and “moped” have the meanings given those terms in ORS 801.345 and 801.365. (c) “Occupying” means in, or upon, or entering into or alighting from.
    (d) “Pedestrian” means a person while not occupying a self-pro- pelled vehicle other than a wheelchair or a similar low-powered motorized or mechanically propelled vehicle that is designed specifically for use by a physically disabled person and that is determined to be medically necessary for the occupant of the wheelchair or other low-powered vehicle.
    (e) “Private passenger motor vehicle” means a four-wheel passen- ger or station wagon type motor vehicle not used as a public or livery conveyance, and includes any other four-wheel motor vehi- cle of the utility, pickup body, sedan delivery or panel truck type not used for wholesale or retail delivery other than farming, a self- propelled mobile home, and a farm truck.
    PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION BENEFITS	105
    742.524 Contents of personal injury protection benefits; deductibles.
    (1) Personal injury protection benefits as required by ORS 742.520 shall consist of the following payments for the injury or death of each person:
    (a) All reasonable and necessary expenses of medical, hospital, dental, surgical, ambulance and prosthetic services incurred within one year after the date of the person’s injury, but not more than $15,000 in the aggregate for all such expenses of the person. Expenses of medical, hospital, dental, surgical, ambulance and prosthetic services shall be presumed to be reasonable and neces- sary unless the provider is given notice of denial of the charges not more than 60 calendar days after the insurer receives from the provider notice of the claim for the services. At any time during the first 50 calendar days after the insurer receives notice of
    claim, the provider shall, within 10 business days, answer in writ- ing questions from the insurer regarding the claim. For purposes of determining when the 60-day period provided by this para- graph has elapsed, counting of days shall be suspended if the provider does not supply written answers to the insurer within 10 days and shall not resume until the answers are supplied.
    (b) If the injured person is usually engaged in a remunerative occupation and if disability continues for at least 14 days, 70 per- cent of the loss of income from work during the period of the injured person’s disability until the date the person is able to return to the person’s usual occupation. This benefit is subject to a maximum payment of $1,250 per month and a maximum pay- ment period in the aggregate of 52 weeks. As used in this para- graph, “income” includes but is not limited to salary, wages, tips, commissions, professional fees and profits from an individually owned business or farm.
    (c) If the injured person is not usually engaged in a remunerative occupation and if disability continues for at least 14 days, the expenses reasonably incurred by the injured person for essential services in lieu of the services the person would have performed without income during the period of the person’s disability until the date the person is reasonably able to perform such essential services. This benefit is subject to a maximum payment of $30 per day and a maximum payment period in the aggregate of 52 weeks.
    (d) All reasonable and necessary funeral expenses incurred within one year after the date of the person’s injury, but not more than $2,500.

    (e) If the injured person is a parent of a minor child and is required to be hospitalized for a minimum of 24 hours, $15 per day for child care, with payments to begin after the initial 24 hours of hospitalization and to be made for as long as the person is unable to return to work if the person is engaged in a remuner- ative occupation or for as long as the person is unable to perform essential services that the person would have performed without income if the person is not usually engaged in a remunerative occupation, but not to exceed $450.
    (2) With respect to the insured person and members of that person’s family residing in the same household, an insurer may offer forms of coverage for the benefits required by subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c) of this section with deductibles of up to $250.
    UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE
    742.504 Required provisions of uninsured motorist coverage (Excerpted) (The complete text of this statute is available in the Oregon State website listed in the Resources Section). Every policy required to provide the coverage specified in ORS 742.502 shall provide uninsured motorist coverage which in each instance is no less favorable in any respect to the insured or the ben- eficiary than if the following provisions were set forth in the policy. However, nothing contained in this section shall require the insurer to reproduce in such policy the particular language of any of the follow- ing provisions:
    (1)(a) The insurer will pay all sums which the insured, the heirs or the legal representative of the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as general and special damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured vehicle. Determination as to whether the insured, the insured’s heirs or the insured’s legal representative is legally entitled to recover such damages, and if so, the amount there- of, shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer, or, in the event of disagreement, may be determined by arbitration as provided in subsection (10) of this section.
    (2) As used in this policy: (a) “Insured,” when unqualified, means when applied to unin- sured motorist coverage:

    (B) Any child residing in the household of the named insured if the insured has performed the duties of a parent to the child by rearing the child as the insured’s own although the child is not related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption; and (C) Any other person while occupying an insured vehicle pro- vided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured.
    (b) “Insured vehicle,” except as provided in paragraph (c) of this provision, means:
    (A) The vehicle described in the policy or a newly acquired or substitute vehicle, as each of those terms is defined in the public liability coverage of the policy, insured under the public liability provisions of the policy; or
    (B) A nonowned vehicle operated by the named insured or spouse if a resident of the same household; provided the actu- al use thereof is with the permission of the owner of such vehi- cle and such vehicle is not owned by nor furnished for the reg- ular or frequent use of the insured or any member of the same household.
    (c) “Insured vehicle” does not include a trailer of any type unless such trailer is a described vehicle in the policy. (d) “Uninsured vehicle,” except as provided in paragraph (e) of this provision, means:
    (A) A vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is no collectible automobile bodily injury liability insurance, in at least the amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death under ORS 806.070 applicable at the time of the accident with respect to any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such vehicle, or with respect to which there is such collectible bodily injury liability insur- ance applicable at the time of the accident but the insurance company writing the same denies coverage thereunder or, with- in two years of the date of the accident, such company writing

    the same becomes voluntarily or involuntarily declared bank- rupt or for which a receiver is appointed or becomes insolvent. It shall be a disputable presumption that a vehicle is uninsured in the event the insured and the insurer, after reasonable efforts, fail to discover within 90 days from the date of the accident, the existence of a valid and collectible automobile bodily injury liability insurance applicable at the time of the accident. (B) A hit-and-run vehicle as defined in paragraph (f ) of this provision. (C) A phantom vehicle as defined in paragraph (g) of this provision.
